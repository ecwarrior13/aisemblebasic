# New Chat Implementation Plan

## Overview
The goal is to implement the functionality for creating a new chat with an AI agent. This will involve both frontend and backend components working together.

## Components Involved
1. `ChatSelector` - Top bar component showing agent name and New Chat button
2. `ChatMessages` - Main chat area showing messages or empty state
3. `ChatInterface` - Parent component coordinating the chat functionality

## Data Flow
1. User clicks "New Chat" button in ChatSelector
2. Frontend calls the createAgentChat mutation
3. Backend creates a new chat in the database
4. Frontend updates the UI to show the new chat

## State Management
- Need to track current chat ID
- Need to track list of available chats
- Need to handle loading states during chat creation

## User Experience
1. Initial State:
   - Shows agent name
   - Shows "No chats yet" message
   - New Chat button is visible

2. After Creating Chat:
   - New chat becomes active
   - Chat area becomes ready for messages
   - Chat selector updates to show available chats

## Error Handling
- Handle cases where chat creation fails
- Show appropriate error messages
- Maintain consistent UI state
